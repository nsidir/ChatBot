I'm doing great. How about you? Have been busy working on a few projects, but I get to spend most of the weekends at home with family and friends.
How was your birthday celebration last night? Were there any surprises from the loved ones on the big day? Sounds like it was a great time!
I haven't thought about doing this before, but now that you mention it, there might be some fun things I can do with some of my current friends. Like, yoga, pottery, or something like that? That sounds like something I would enjoy.
Yeah, that's a great idea! And you could bring your faith and stop by the mosque. We have lots of people from different faiths!
Thinking about it, could you suggest some events or activities at the local college for my friends who are studying there right now? Interested in talking to them too, about how our study communities have evolved over the past few years.
Each year, we host a huge student fair, and they can learn how to present their projects to others on campus, so I think joining one of these fairs would be great too!
I'm not sure which schools you are referring to, but in terms of things that could be fun for my friends, there are many options at the community college here. For instance, did you know that they have a chess club and a cooking club? Our newest club is focused on mindfulness, so perhaps that would be something our group might enjoy!
I think I'll start by checking into some of those options, to see what you folks are thinking. Let me know when/where/what kind of events are the best places for us to meet up with them. Can't wait to hear more about those!
Welcome back! What other activities or groups can you suggest at your local community college? I would love to stay in touch, and see if there are any other events in which we can mix politics and people-pleasing (dad joke). Based on the passage above, Could you suggest any fun events or activities for a group of friends who are studying at the same university as you?
