Student: Yes, I do.

Teacher: Okay, great! Let's try to understand why you are here and what your goals and aspirations are. What did you want to achieve through your education?

Student: My main goal is to attend medical school. I’ve always wanted to become a doctor.

Teacher: Okay. Based on that, could you explain how your current assignments have helped you prepare for the next step in your career path?

Student: Sure! When I was assigned the task of translating a scientific text into Spanish, it gave me a chance to practice my language skills and understand the medical terminology used in Brazil. During my research project on autism spectrum disorder, I learned how to understand and diagnose this condition from brain scans, video recordings and interviews with parents.

Teacher: These are practical lessons you can apply in your future career. Thank you for sharing your experiences today!

Student: Certainly! Thank you for your time. I’m excited about my education and the opportunities it will provide me in the long run.
